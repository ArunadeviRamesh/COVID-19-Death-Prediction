                     <h2> Objective of our project </h2>
<p font-size=45;>People infected with the Corona Virus (COVID-19) experience mild to moderate respiratory illness. With the availability of massive amounts of COVID-19 data, there is a growing urge for more efficient computational algorithms to predict the rate of mortality to enhance security, ensure public safety and develop medical diagnostics. Machine Learning algorithms help us achieve this objective by finding patterns in the massive amounts of COVID-19 data.<br> Regression models are powerful supervised machine learning techniques to classify large-scale data. This paper examines by applying the regression models generated by machine learning algorithms to predict the expected COVID-19 deaths. This research uses Linear Regression and Lasso Regression techniques on world COVID-19 data. The experimental results show the R-squared statistics score of 0.99, which means that our model explains 99% of the variance.</p>
<p>The objective of this research article is to investigate the huge available COVID-19 world dataset and hence could contribute to a significant amount of robust data and compute a predictive model for World dataset using machine learning algorithms called Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The results obtained from this dataset is also compare the efficiency of these techniques based on various error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-Squared value, and Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE).</p><br><hr>
